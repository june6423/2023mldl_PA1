Dear Professor Alice:

Professor Foo suggested I reach out to you regarding my thesis work about
machine learning.

I know you have done extensive research in this area, and I think meeting
with you would help me a lot.
Would you be available for a short meeting next week?

I look forward to your reply.
Sincerely,
Bob
