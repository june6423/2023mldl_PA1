Dear Professor Hanks,

I am a student in your class.

After getting the results of last week's exam, I realized that I am struggling
with more than one topic in the course. I want to do my best in this class, and
would like to review my exam with you. Is there a time we could meet later this
week to talk further?

I look forward to your reply.
Best regards,
Soo Kim
