Dear Professor Foo,

I am a student in your machine learning class.

I have a question about the second term project and I was not able to find the
answer on the syllabus. Should our project be only about the topics listed on
the second part of the syllabus, or can I incorporate topics from the whole
course, as long as it fits with the subject of the class?

I look forward to hearing from you.
Best regards,
Bar
